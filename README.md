# Register an Account
* When opening the app for the first time, users are prompted to create an account.

* Basic details such as username, email, and password are collected.

* Registration data is sent securely to the MockAPI backend for storage.


# Login to Access Todos
* Once registered, users can log in using their credentials.

* Successful login grants access to their personalized todo list.

* The session is maintained while the app is open, ensuring seamless navigation.



# View All Todos
* The Home Screen displays all todos fetched from MockAPI using a GET request.

* Todos are listed with key details such as:

* Title

* Description

* Due Date

* Completion Status


# Edit Existing Todo
* Users can select any todo item to update its details.

* Editing allows changes to:

* Title

* Description

* Due Date

* Completion Status

# Delete Todo
* Unwanted tasks can be removed permanently with a single tap.

* A DELETE request is made to the backend, removing the task and updating the list in real time.
